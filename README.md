# Home Assistant (Personal)
This is my personal home assistant setup with Homekit Infused v3.6.2
Lovelace examples for HKI might not be up to date for newer versions than 3.6.2!!

This is meant for inspiration and not to copy, if you are looking for Homekit Infused click the links below:

You can also simply visit the master branch for quick links: https://github.com/jimz011/homekit-infused/

NOTE: The automations in this example are no longer used, I recently moved all automations over to Node-Red, though ALL automations that can be found here should work as expected and are kept here for future reference.
